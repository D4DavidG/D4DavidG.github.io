List of ChatGPT contributions

I gave chatgpt all of the lecture slide decks (semantic HTML, CSS, responsive design, forms), sample HTML/CSS files, my linkedin, and my resume.

This was also so that whenever I asked for help with code it would only do what was in the scope of the class. 


For index.html:

* Assisted in writing code for implementing accessible “skip to main content” link.
* Implemented neon-themed top navigation with button-style links that smooth-scroll to sections.

For project-pocketprofessors.html

Assisted in writing a comprehensive project page:
  • Used memory from when it helped me with pocket professors and scanned github for all knowledge relating to my project
  • Overview, Key Features, Technologies, How It Works, Role & Contributions, Credits & Links.
  • Added optional developer quick-start block.
* Fixed structure for validator and consistent styling.

For project-contact-manager.html

* Rewrote as a polished page emphasizing your role as PROJECT MANAGER.
  • Used memory from when it helped me with pocket professors and scanned github for all knowledge relating to my project
  • Overview, Key Features, Technologies, How It Works, Role & Contributions, Credits & Links.

For styles.css

* Introduced a global NEON THEME (black background, neon green #00ff00, soft/faint glow variables).
* Organized CSS into logical sections (base/vars → base/typography → header/topnav → components → utilities → responsive).
* Converted top nav words into GLOWING BUTTON LINKS (.topnav .btn) with hover/focus glow.
* Enabled smooth scrolling (respects prefers-reduced-motion).
* Implemented avatar styling:
  • Neon hover glow for profile/avatar.

For README.md

* Wrote an updated README with:
  • Professional intro and links: portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, live resume.
  • What’s new (neon theme, glowing buttons, smooth scroll, avatar glow).
  • Skills badges.
  • Featured Projects (PocketProfessors and CS Majors vs Gorilla/Contact Manager), including your Project Manager role.
  • Highlights (awards, scholarships, foundation exam) and GitHub stats links.


CLEANUP, VALIDATION, AND FIXES

* Reorganized CSS blocks for clarity; no property/value changes.
* Performed overall wording/typo cleanup recommendations (e.g., “accessible”, “panel”, “resource allocation”) for polish.
* Add global focus outline: `a:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--neon); outline-offset: 2px; }`
